There are many map pins in the office that have become somewhat damaged through use. I used OpenVINO to build a solution for determining whether map pins can be reused.

I completed this project locally, but the path link has not been modified yet. The file path needs to be modified during testing.

The current OpenVINO version 2023.2.0-13089-cfd42bd2cb0-HEAD will cause an error when inferencer
Inferencer must use version 2023.0.0
